üóû Newsletter automation inspired by the [rOpenSci
Newsletter](https://ropensci.org/news/), and Ma√´lle Salmon‚Äôs post on
same, [‚ÄúHow we curate our monthly
newsletter‚Äù](https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/06/24/news-meta/) (24 June,
2021).

Resources from above:

-   [Hugo
    archetype](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb3/tree/master/archetypes/newsletter)
    for parameterized R Markdown report (view
    [index.md](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb3/blob/master/archetypes/newsletter/index.md)).  
-   [rOpenSci Package Registry](https://github.com/ropensci/roregistry)
    (n.b.¬†this is mainly so we can see what information/the data
    structure rOpenSci feeds into its ‚Äúreport‚Äù/newsletter).  
-   [makeregistry](https://github.com/ropensci-org/makeregistry) - how
    the above registry is generated.  
-   [codemetar](https://github.com/ropensci/codemetar): an R package for
    generating and working with codemeta, as described at
    <https://codemeta.github.io>.  
-   [rOpenSci full-content
    newsfeed](https://ropensci.org/rbloggers/index.xml) (figure out why
    [their
    layout](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb3/blob/master/themes/ropensci/layouts/rbloggers/rss.xml)
    looks so different to
    [ours](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/index.xml); see also their
    non-full-content [RSS
    feed](https://ropensci.org/tags/newsletter/index.xml) which I think
    is generated from the [outputs
    section](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb3/blob/04b4fe7c3bf95cc805ecebe2aca29e849dc40af5/config.toml#L37-L41)
    of their theme toml file).  
-   [Newsletter
    checklist](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb3#newsletter).  
-   [Newsletter tag page](https://ropensci.org/tags/newsletter/).
