üóû Newsletter automation inspired by the [rOpenSci Newsletter](https://ropensci.org/news/), and Ma√´lle Salmon's post on same, [‚ÄúHow we curate our monthly newsletter‚Äù](https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/06/24/news-meta/) (24 June, 2021).

Resources from above:  

  *  [Hugo archetype](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb3/tree/master/archetypes/newsletter) for parameterized R Markdown report (view [index.md](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb3/blob/master/archetypes/newsletter/index.md)).  
  * [rOpenSci Package Registry](https://github.com/ropensci/roregistry) (n.b. this is mainly so we can see what information/the data structure rOpenSci feeds into its ‚Äúreport‚Äù/newsletter).  
  * [makeregistry](https://github.com/ropensci-org/makeregistry) - how the above registry is generated.  
  * [codemetar](https://github.com/ropensci/codemetar): an R package for generating and working with codemeta, as described at <https://codemeta.github.io>.  
  * [rOpenSci full-content newsfeed](https://ropensci.org/rbloggers/index.xml) (figure out why [their layout](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb3/blob/master/themes/ropensci/layouts/rbloggers/rss.xml) looks so different to [ours](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/index.xml); see also their non-full-content [RSS feed](https://ropensci.org/tags/newsletter/index.xml) which I think is generated from the [outputs section](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb3/blob/04b4fe7c3bf95cc805ecebe2aca29e849dc40af5/config.toml#L37-L41) of their theme toml file).  
  * [Newsletter checklist](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb3#newsletter).  
  * [Newsletter tag page](https://ropensci.org/tags/newsletter/).  

Other resources:

  * [`build_news()` code](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/blob/master/R/build-news.R) from pkgdown.  
  * [tidymodels newsletter](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/03/tidymodels-2021-q1/).  
  * [New in knitr](https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/04/20/knitr-fig-alt/).  
  * See also (now defunct) RStudio internal newsletter updates.
